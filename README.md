The Jellybeans scheme comes from https://vimawesome.com/plugin/jellybeans-vim which features a 256 color depth of warm hues and vibrant colors on the vim interface
The fugitive vim came from the vundle script that was provided via the vundle git hub, I just kept it on there, I did not add a script because I have never learned to code in bash before. EVerything else I feel as if I was able to do and had success on.

The script appears to create the file using the commands that I used which were chmod +x (which changes the ownership to be able to execute the file) which I titled viminstall.sh code was created using information from 7.3 in Unix and Linux system administration handbook
